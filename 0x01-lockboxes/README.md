#  0x01. Lockboxes
## The Domains/Concepts covered in this project: `Python`

This project introduced me to solving the lockboxes problem in Python, focusing on determining if all boxes in a list can be unlocked. I learned how to traverse nested lists using search algorithms to track accessible boxes and efficiently manage keys.
