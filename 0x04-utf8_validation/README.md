# 0x04. UTF-8 Validation
## The Domains/Concepts covered in this project: `Python`

This project introduced me to UTF-8 validation in Python, focusing on checking whether a list of integers represents valid UTF-8 encoded characters. I learned how to interpret byte sequences, follow encoding rules, and validate data using bitwise operations based on the UTF-8 standard.

**Technical interview preparation:**

  * Create a UTF-8 validation module in python.  
  * You are not allowed to google anything
  * Whiteboard first

  * [0-validate_utf8.py](./0-validate_utf8.py)
  * [0-validate_utf8_test.txt](./0-validate_utf8_test.txt)
