# 0x06. Star Wars API
## The Domains/Concepts covered in this project: `JavaScript`


In this project I created a Node.js script that fetches and prints the names of all characters appearing in a given Star Wars film using the Star Wars API (SWAPI). I learned how to make HTTP requests, handle asynchronous operations with Promises, and retrieve and print character names from a specified Star Wars film.
