# 0x08. Making Change
## The Domains/Concepts covered in this project: `Python`

In this projected I implemented an algorithm to solve the coin change problem in Python, focusing on determining the minimum number of coins needed to reach a given total. I learned how to implement greedy and dynamic programming approaches to optimize coin selection and minimize computations.
