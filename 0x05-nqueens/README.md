# 0x05. N Queens
## The Domains/Concepts covered in this project: `Python` `OOP`

In this project I created the N-Queens algorithm using Python, a classic algorithmic challenge in combinatorial optimization. I learned how to implement backtracking to efficiently place queens on an N×N chessboard while ensuring no two queens attack each other.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

**10. N queens**

The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. Write a program that solves the N queens problem.

Usage: `nqueens N`
  * If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments, print `Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
If N is not an integer, print N must be a number, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
The program should print every possible solution to the problem
One solution per line
Format: see example
You don’t have to print the solutions in a specific order
You are only allowed to import the sys module
