# ALX Technical Interviews Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of technical interview projects from the ALX Software Engineering Program, focused on problem-solving with `Python` and `JavaScript`. These projects cover essential algorithms, data structures, and coding challenges commonly tested in technical interviews. Through this repository, I demonstrate my ability to write efficient, scalable solutions and optimize code for real-world problem-solving.
