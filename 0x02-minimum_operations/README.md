# 0x02. Minimum Operations
## The Domains/Concepts covered in this project: `Python`

This project introduced me to solving the minimum operations coding challenge in Python, focusing on optimizing string manipulation. I learned how to determine the fewest number of operations needed to generate exactly n 'H' characters using prime factorization and efficient counting techniques.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

**Technical interview preparation:**

  * Create a function that Computes the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n `H characters`. 
  * You are not allowed to google anything
  * Whiteboard first

  * [0-minoperations.py](./0-minoperations.py)
  * [test_0_minoperations.txt](./test_0_minoperations.txt)
